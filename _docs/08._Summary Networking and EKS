Hello Cloud Gurus.
Congratulations for making it to this point.
It has been quite an interesting chapter,
so let's review what we have learned through it.
We started talking about the importance
of keeping resources private and we learned how
to make our cluster private with EKS CTL.
Remember, it's just this little piece of YAML
that will do the job.
I also recommended the open VPN course here
in a cloud guru, which I am sure is a great way
to improve even more your security posture.
Then we moved to load balancing and DNS with EKS.
We talked about the AWS Load Balancer Controller
as the ideal tool to manage load balancing in our cluster.
We also learned how to keep our communication
from the end user secure with encryption
using TLS/SSL certificates with ACM.
And we learned about external DNS,
an open source project
that will manage domain name integrations with our cluster.
We moved very quickly to the installation
of our bookstore application,
starting with the DynamoDB tables as the data source
of our application.
Remember that we used cloud formation for deploying these.
And then moving to the microservices using Helm
for installing them in our EKS cluster.
And finally, we talked about the VPC CNI add-on,
which is an open source project developed
by AWS that implements
the Container Network Interface for Kubernetes.
By default, it is already installed on our EKS cluster
and it's very easy to manage it from the console
to do updates for example.
We customize it to expand reachability
of our networking with a secondary CIDR in our VPC.
So now let me ask you a question.
What else you can do with EKS networking?
Think about AWS local zones
or protecting different namespaces
or granular networking segmentation right there
on your EKS cluster.
Ideas are endless.
Just take these concepts as little building blocks
so you can create your own solution with them.
That's all for this chapter.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Otherwise, feel free to move to the next one.
Thank you.
